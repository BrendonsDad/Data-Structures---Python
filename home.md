# Basic Data Structure Concepts
### By Aubury Orr
## Welcome
You are on fire! You have already learned so much about programming, way more than you might have thought possible not too long ago. Take a moment to appreciate how far you have come. Don't get lazy though, there is still much to learn! You might have heard the term "data structures" tossed around here and there, and you probably wondered what that ment. Well don't worry, soon you will know the fundementals of data structures. As a result, you will learn:
- What a queue is
- How to add to and remove from queues
- What a linked list is
- How to traverese and manipulate data from a linked list
- What it means to be a 'doubly linked list'
- What a binary tree is and how to traverse it
- Why they are helpful for program efficiencey
- How to add to and evaluate data in a binary tree

# Closing Remarks
Well done! You have made it through this tutorial. By now, you should have a fair understanding of queues, linked lists, and binary trees. Feel free to continue studying and using this tutorial as a reference. Good luck with all your interviews!
